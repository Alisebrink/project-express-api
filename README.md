# Express API Project

This is an API that gets books with several different endpoints. Use "/endpoints" to see all the endpoints.

## The problem

Difficulty this week has been that I was sick so I had limited time to work on my project. 

## View it live

Project API is deployed on Heroku here: https://books-api-heroku-deploy.herokuapp.com/
